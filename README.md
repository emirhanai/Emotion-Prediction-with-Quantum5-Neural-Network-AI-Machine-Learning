# **Emotion Prediction with Semi Supervised Learning of Machine Learning Software with RC Algorithm - By Emirhan BULUT**
I have created an artificial intelligence software that can make an emotion prediction based on the text you have written using the Semi Supervised Learning method and the RC algorithm. I used very simple codes and it was a software that focused on solving the problem. I aim to create the 2nd version of the software using RNN (Recurrent Neural Network). I hope I was able to create an example for you to use in your thesis and projects.

Happy learning!
